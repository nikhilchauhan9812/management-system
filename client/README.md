# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Online Task Management System

## Description
This project is a full-stack web application for managing tasks online. It allows users to create, update, delete, and view tasks, as well as assign them to other users. The application consists of a backend API built with Node.js and Express.js, a MongoDB database for storing task data, and a frontend built with React.js.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/online-task-management-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd online-task-management-system
    ```
3. Install dependencies for both backend and frontend:
    ```bash
    cd server && npm install
    cd ../client && npm install
    ```

## Usage
1. Start the backend server:
    ```bash
    cd ../server && npm start
    ```
2. Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    cd ../client && npm start
    ```
3. Open your web browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to access the application.
